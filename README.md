This project was written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda. The relevant Python packages for this project are as follows:

- pandas
- numpy
- math

- ssklearn.svm (SVC)
- matplotlib

### 2. Project Motivation
This project is the Capstone project of my Data Scientist nanodegree with Udacity. As students in the nanodegree, we have the option to take part in the Starbucks Capstone Challenge.
For the challenge, Udacity provided simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app.

### 3.BUsiness Analysis Questions
Q. what is the highest number of customer age?

Q.which customers are more?

Q.Which was the year of highest number of membership?

Q. Why the male customers are more?

Q.which offer is more popular?
